# OroSidebarBundle

OroSidebarBundle adds sidebars to the desktop version of the Oro application management UI and provides the ability for application users to enable or disable this feature in the system configuration menu.

The bundle enables developers to create sidebar widgets as Javascript modules and configure its default values in the YAML configuration files.

Every application user can configure their own widgets set in each enabled sidebar.
